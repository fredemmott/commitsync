# Git CommitSync

Automatically sync your commits to a local repository.

## Installation

1. Install Rust
2. Cargo build

## Usage

1. Create a repository to sync to; while it's possible to sync to your main
  repository, this isn't usually a good idea: CommitCloud will create a lot
  of branches, which are largely noise - and they'll automatically be public.
  It's usually best to create a private repository somewhere.
2. Configure passwordless access to this repository - for example, via ssh-agent.
4. Run `/path/to/commitsync init` (or `commitsync.exe`) to setup the repo
5. Run `git cs` to view synced commits
