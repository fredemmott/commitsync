# CommitCloud for Git

## Usage

1. Create a repository to sync to; while it's possible to sync to your main
  repository, this isn't usually a good idea: CommitCloud will create a lot
  of branches, which are largely noise - and they'll automatically be public.
  It's usually best to create a private repository somewhere.
2. Configure passwordless access to this repository - for example, via ssh-agent.
4. Run `bin/cc-init` from inside your working directory
5. NOT IMPLEMENTED: Run `git cc` to switch commits
